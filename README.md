# markdown-css 
It contains a template for writing in markdown and outputting the file as a pdf in an <strong>academic writing style</strong>.  
It is an evolved version of the original academic template offered by typora https://theme.typora.io/theme/Academic.  
It also combines the code by Leaf Hsiao https://github.com/leaf-hsiao/catfish.  
The pdf file will appear to have the format of 12pt font-size, 1.5em line-height, and Times New Roman font-family.

  Thanks! Enjoy your writing!  
****  

I update the line-height of titles. Now it looks much better!  
ps. To make it clear, in order to have 12pt font-size, you'll have to insert the following code into your file (not the css file but the one you're working on!).  
```ios
<font size=3.5> 
your writing 
</font>
```
Similarly, if you want to have <strong>pure</strong> black font-color (for the original design isn't!), you'll have to insert the following code into the thing that you're writing.
```ios
<font color=#000000> 
your writing 
</font>
```

Have fun!
