# markdown-css 
It contains a template for writing in markdown and putting out the file as a pdf in an <strong>academic writing style</strong>.  
It is an evolved version of the original academic template offered by typora https://github.com/typora/typora-theme-gallery.  
It also combines the code by Leaf Hsiao https://github.com/leaf-hsiao/catfish.  
The pdf file will appear to have the format of 12pt font-size, 1.5em line-height, and Times New Roman font-family.
